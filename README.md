# KeyLogger (KLG1) (WINDOWS)

## Version = 1.0.1 

It's not autorun, you should run it for the first time. then it will be auto-start on windows, if the KLG1.exe is deleted by the victim. CONGRATULATIONS you failed LMAO.
Some Anti Virus can detect this, so you need to allow this. so the victim can't know it.


## HOW TO SEND VIA EMAIL?
automatically sent by email when the computer is turned on. If the victim is not connected to the internet it will wait until the victim is connected to the internet.

NOTE*: put your spam / fake email  in the code.
