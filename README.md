# ONLY FOR STUDY PURPOSES! 
# KeyLogger (KLG1) (WINDOWS)
# Version = 1.0.1 
It's not auto run, you should run it for the first time. then it will be auto-start on windows, if the KLG1.exe is deleted by the victim. CONGRATULATIONS you failed LMAO.
you should allow it in "AV" and hide it. so victim wont know it.

# HOW TO SEND VIA EMAIL?
automatically sent by email when the computer is turned on. OF COURSE YOU NEED AN INTERNET! Oh don't have internet? it will sent when you connected to internet. Sorry :)
NOTE*: CHANGE THE EMAIL TO YOUR EMAIL SO YOU WILL GET THE NOTIFICATION FROM IT.
