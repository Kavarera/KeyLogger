# KeyLogger (KLG1) for Windows

## Version: 1.0.1 

‚ö†Ô∏è Please Note: This project is solely for educational purposes. Running it without consent is both unethical and potentially illegal.

### Usage:
1. This is not an autorun program. You need to execute it for the first time.
2. It will auto-start on Windows after the initial run. In case the KLG1.exe is deleted by the victim, it won't restart automatically.

üéâ If the victim deletes KLG1.exe, they've successfully thwarted your attempt! LMAO. Some antivirus programs can detect this, so make sure to allow it to run.

## How to Send via Email?
The logged data is automatically sent via email when the computer is turned on. If the victim is not connected to the internet, it will wait until an internet connection is established.

**Note**: Replace the placeholder with your spam/fake email in the code.
